\description{
Used to validate internal consistency of submission metadata parsed using
the default parser. Performs several checks on EGA dataset for submission,
ensuring that aliases for studies, experiments, samples, runs, analyses and
datasets are  are properly linked, as they will be replaced with provisional
or accession IDs during submission process. Displays a success message if
all validation passed or a summary message if validation failed. In addition
it returns a data frame with validation details.
